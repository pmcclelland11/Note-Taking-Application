# UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp - Module 11 Challenge
## Note-Taking-Application
For this assignment, I was given starter code that contained a front-end template for a Note Taking Application. It was my job to build the back end, connect the two side, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku. The purpose of this app is to allow users write, save, and view notes, with a focus on connecting the user interface to the backend server.
